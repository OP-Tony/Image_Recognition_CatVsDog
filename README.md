# Image_Recognition_CatVsDog
Deep learning project using CNNs and transfer learning for image classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Cats vs Dogs datasets.
# üêæ Image Recognition with Deep Learning

This repository contains a **Google Colab project** implementing image classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning**.  
We train models on three datasets:
- MNIST (handwritten digits)
- CIFAR-10 (10 object categories)
- Cats vs Dogs (binary classification)

## üîπ Key Features
- Data preprocessing & augmentation
- CNN architectures for MNIST & CIFAR-10
- Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for Cats vs Dogs
- Performance evaluation with accuracy curves, confusion matrices, and ROC curves
- Custom image prediction support
